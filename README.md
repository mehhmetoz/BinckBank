# BinckBank Assignment

1-We have some legacy data, which we would like to transform. Legacy data is stored in flat files on a file-system. Some of the files include post codes and we need to identify, where that data is and pull out the lines, which include post codes. Please provide code which will do the above.

2-Please design a service, which would send out «smart alerts» (notifications via push/email/text messages) to clients based on events in their investment portfolios. 

3-Assume, you’re asked to create a simple REST API for a CRM system. Please describe what you would do and draft the API.

4-We use git as a repository for our code. Please share how you see an ideal git branching, given we use three stages for continuous integration: dev, stag, prod. How should versions work? How should hot fixes be deployed?
